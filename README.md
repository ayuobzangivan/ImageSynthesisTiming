# ImageGenerator-TF

This repository demonstrates a simple approach to measure the execution time of a neural network generator applied to a test dataset. It includes functionality for generating images and timing their execution for performance evaluation.

---

## Features
- **Generate Images**: Create synthetic images from a test dataset using a pre-trained generator.
- **Performance Timing**: Measure execution time for inference to assess model speed and efficiency.

---

## Code Explanation

### Key Components
1. **Dataset**: The `test_dataset` is iterated to take inputs (`inp`) and targets (`tar`).
2. **Generator**: A pre-trained generator model (`generator`) is applied to generate images from the test dataset.
3. **Execution Time**: The time taken to process one batch of images is calculated using Python's `time` module.

### Example Usage

```python
import time
start_time = time.time()
for inp, tar in test_dataset.take(1):
  generate_images(generator, inp, tar)
end_time = time.time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
print("Execution time: {:.5f} seconds".format(execution_time))

Expected Output

The script prints the execution time in seconds for generating a batch of images, such as:

Execution time: 0.12345 seconds

Requirements

    Python >= 3.7
    TensorFlow or PyTorch (based on your model setup)
    Pre-trained generator model
    A prepared test_dataset

How to Use

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/ImageGenerator-TF.git
cd ImageGenerator-TF

Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Add your pre-trained generator model and test_dataset to the script.
Run the script to generate images and measure performance:

    python main.py

Future Improvements

    Expand to test multiple datasets.
    Add support for visualizing generated images.
    Include functionality to measure GPU vs CPU performance.
